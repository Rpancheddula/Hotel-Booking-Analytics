Velora Hotel Booking Analytics Case Study

1. Introduction

This case study presents end-to-end data analysis and reporting solutions for Velora Hotel bookings. The dataset includes 5,000+ booking records across multiple channels and loyalty levels. The goal was to design a structured analytics workflow, apply data cleaning, create robust DAX models, and build a fully interactive Power BI dashboard.

2. Problem Statement

Hotel booking data is often scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to analyze customer behavior, loyalty program effectiveness, and revenue trends. This case study focuses on Velora Hotel bookings, aiming to design a solution that tracks and visualizes hotel performance for better insight into customer and revenue trends.

3. Dataset Overview

Collected Bookings: 5,000+

Key Columns: Booking ID | Loyalty Level | Channel | Status | Stay Date | Revenue | Room Rate | Cancellation

Data Frequency: Daily booking updates

Granularity: Booking-level (each row = one booking)

Challenges

High cancellation rate (~29%)

Inconsistent loyalty tier naming

Multiple booking channels with overlapping categories

4. Solution Architecture

Objective: Design an end-to-end pipeline for collecting, cleaning, and visualizing booking activity.

Proposed Data Flow: Booking System → Data Extraction (Manual/API) → Data Cleaning (Excel/Python) → Data Processing (Aggregation by Loyalty, Channel, Status) → Data Storage (CSV / Power BI Dataset) → Visualization & Insights (Power BI Dashboard)

Excel – Data cleaning and consolidation

Python (pandas) – Pre-processing and transformation

Power BI – Visualization and reporting

5. Analytical Focus & Metrics

Booking Count – Total number of bookings

Cancellation Rate – Percentage of cancelled bookings

Revenue – Total revenue generated

Average Room Rate – Revenue per room

Booking Trends – Daily and weekly booking patterns

Loyalty Segmentation – Distribution of bookings across loyalty tiers

Channel Mix – Contribution of different booking channels
